      <p className="mt-2"> I've been immersing myself in the world of web development and have gained experience with key technologies like HTML, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
I started my journey with HTML, learning the basics of structuring web pages. As I grew more comfortable, I began exploring Tailwind CSS, which has quickly become one of my favorite tools for styling. I love how it enables rapid prototyping and helps create responsive designs with ease.
